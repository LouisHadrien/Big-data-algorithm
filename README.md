# Big-data-algithm

This file contains 2 assignments from the big data algorithms techniques and platforms.
The fisrt one is about the implementation of some map/reduce tasks (join between 2 datasets and matrix multiplication) using hadoop on cloudera.
The second one  is about using Spark with python: manipulation of dataframes, mySQL spark and a text classification problem using its machine learning library 

# Hadoop map/reduce

The first algorithm is a join between 2 datasets ( {TV show, number of viewers} and {TV show, channel}) that are generated by the file : make_join2data.py. Running the following 2 commands generate the data used:
python make_join2data.py y 1000 13 > join2_gennumA.txt
python make_join2data.py y 200017 > join2_gennumB.txt
The map reduce task consist in returning the total number of views for each TV show played on channel ABC:
mapper > join2_mapper.py
reducer > join2_reducer.py

The second algorithm compile the product of 2 matrices.
The matrices are randomly generated by the file > make_matrix.py. The size of the matrices has to be changed in the code. 

mapper > matrice_mapper
reducer > matrice_reducer

# Spark

Assignement on Spark with Python. The fisrt part is about the manipulation of datframes and mySQL on spark. The second part is a text classification problemen using the machine learning library of Spark (see Jupyter notebook)
